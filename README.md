# üìã Customer Manager

Welcome to the Customer Manager project! üöÄ This simple Proof of Concept (POC) amalgamates React for the frontend and Vite for the build system, showcasing basic CRUD functionalities for managing customers. Through this project, we underscore the seamless integration between frontend technologies and provide insights into modern web development practices. Feel free to explore the codebase and delve into the world of web development with Customer Manager! üíª

The backend code can be seem in the following [repository](https://github.com/maycon-mdrs/VClients).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup

Before running the project, ensure to create an .env file following the structure outlined in .env.example. This file should contain all necessary environment variables for the application to function properly.


| Variable      | Description                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| VITE_API_URL  | The URL of the API endpoint that the frontend consumes. For local development, it is set to `http://localhost:5138/`. Ensure it points to the correct API server address. |

### üöÄ How to Run the Frontend

> [!warning]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:**  
> It is crucial to mention that this project locally utilizes [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pt/) (v8.9.2) instead of npm, although both should be able to interoperate without any issues.

> [!note]
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **System Information:**  
> - npm  ~> v9.8.1  
> - node ~> v18.18.2
