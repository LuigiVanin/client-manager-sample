The backend code can be seem in the following [repository](https://github.com/maycon-mdrs/VClients).

<br />

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup

Before running the project, it is necessary to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine.

> [!note]
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **System Information:**  
> - npm  ~> v9.8.1  
> - node ~> v18.18.2


> [!warning]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:**  
> It is crucial to mention that this project locally utilizes [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pt/) (v8.9.2) instead of npm, although both should be able to interoperate without any issues.



After checking or installing node and npm on your machine it is necessary to clone the git repository of the frontend with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/LuigiVanin/customer-manager-sample.git
```


After all, ensure to create an .env file following the structure outlined in .env.example. This file should contain all necessary environment variables for the application to function properly.


| Variable      | Description                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| VITE_API_URL  | The URL of the API endpoint that the frontend consumes. For local development, it is set to `http://localhost:5138/`. Ensure it points to the correct API server address. |
